    \section{Purpose}
        This style is created for writing notes, and it is designed to reduce eye strain when reading PDFs.
    \section{Colors}
        Colors are inspired by GruvBox and JetBrains Dracula themes, but with WarmBox does its own thing: it doesn't use white color, because I consider it too aggressive and 
        there is no red in "normal" text - it is only allowed in errors.

        \subsection{Code Block}
            \begin{lstlisting}[style=myjava]

                    public static void main(String[] args){  
                        Stream.iterate(1, element -> element + 1)  
                        .filter(element -> element % 5 == 0)  
                        .limit(5)  
                        .forEach(System.out::println);  

                        int i = 1
                        System.out.println("String Example" + i);

        \subsection{Important Frame}
        
        \begin{mdframed}[style=important]
            
            
            Hiding internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods is known as
            \textbf{\textit{data encapsulation}} - a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming.
        \end{mdframed}
